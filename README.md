# Data Analysis & Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

Welcome to my vividBaek GitHub ! 

Here, I focus on data analysis projects with a special interest in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). 

My goal is to explore innovative methods to analyze sensor data and apply machine learning techniques to accurately classify human activities.

## Projects
### Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones
- Objective: Classify activities (such as walking, sitting, lying, etc.) using sensor data from smartphones.
- Key Approaches:
      - Standard train/test split versus LOSO cross-validation.
      - Feature scaling, PCA/t-SNE comparisons, and raw data evaluation.
      - Implementation of models using LightGBM and LSTM.
      - Exploring transfer learning techniques to improve model generalization.
